# GovTribe API

**Note:** This feature is not yet available. We expect the GovTribe API to launch soon.

This repository tracks issues for GovTribe's Integrated Government Contracting and Grant-Making Market Intelligence API. The API is built using [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) and documented in [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md).

## Documentation
https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/govtribe/api/1.0.0

## Access
To get access, you'll need a GovTribe account: https://govtribe.com. All GovTribe accounts come with free API Access. You can generate API Access Tokens at https://govtribe.com/developer.  These tokens are limited to 100/requests per day. If you need more requests, please contact us at help@govtribe.com.

## What Is It?
The API provides a consistent, well-documented, and simple way to retrieve details and relationships about most things involved in the Federal Contracting and Grant-Making process. This includes Federal Contract and Grant Opportunities, Federal Contract and Grant Awards, as well as Vendors, Agencies, and Federal People:

## Update Frequency
Data update frequency varies by type. For example, Federal Contract Opportunities are updated every 15 minutes and Federal Contract Awards are updated every 24 hours. This is a limitation of the underlying data feeds that are used as inputs to the different types. In general, we update our data as fast as possible.
