## What Is It?

This includes Federal Contract and Grant Opportunities, Federal Contract and Grant Awards, as well as Vendors, Agencies, and Federal People:

## Update Frequency
Data update frequency varies by type. For example, Federal Contract Opportunities are updated every 15 minutes and Federal Contract Awards are updated every 24 hours. This is a limitation of the underlying data feeds that are used as inputs to the different types. In general, we update our data as fast as possible.
